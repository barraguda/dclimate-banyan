Welcome to |project|'s documentation!
===========================================

|project| is a library that stores time series data in IPFS. This library is a
wrapper for RÃ¼diger Klaehn's excellent `Banyan library
<https://github.com/Actyx/banyan>`_, written in Rust. This library provides
concrete implementations for the types needed by Banyan and provides a Python
wrapper so that it can be used from Python.
